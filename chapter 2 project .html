<h2> What this quote means to me; </h2>

<p> To me this quote stands out amongst the field of cliche' quotes. Failure truly is the greatest of teachers, bold, but great nonetheless. Through trial and error, humans have evolved from instinctive ways, all the way to architects.</p> <div>Children learn to walk by falling, children learn to ride their bikes by scraped knees; You see, it is through trial and error <strong>and</strong> failure, that evolution keeps mankind persistant in its constant indevors in this thing we call life.</div>
