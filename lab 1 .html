<h3><blockquote>"Hello there"</blockquote> What I enjoy doing in my free time and other  interests.</h3>
<p>One thing i find my self passionate about, among many things, is <em> STAR WARS!!! It all started when i was about 4 years old. I was watching "The Empire Strikes Back!".It was a cool seeing those walkers attack the rebels and than you had the snow speeders hit them with the tow cables. Like whaaat? A lot of people, I safely assume, are not familiar with the EU, or expanded universe.This is where the fun begins.
<div>Everyone knows about yoda, the jedi, storm troopers, ect..But what most people dont know about is the 8 month period after the 3rd film revenge of the sith. The once promising poster boy, Anakin Skywalker, has now transitioned in to the half man half machine, Darth Vader. During this time he had a constent struggle dealing with the outcome of his actions. But through his hate, anger, and passion, he was able to surpress such memories.</div>
<div>Padme, the wife anakin decided to kill, was the only real salvation or thing holding him back from truly devoting to the darkside. It was mostly his rage, constant depression and pain that gave him power. Its crazy to think about star wars and how much it actually plays into my life. I think were kind of like anakin/darth vader in a way. You was the best for you, the world, your family, and youll do whatever it takes to keep them safe. But "whatever it takes" might lead you down the wrong path.</div>
 <div>The force reminds me of a mass conscious like life force flowing through all of us. There is the light and the dark side. Onces manipulating and the other is harder to obtain because its hard for most humans to make the right choice. But between these two, the light and the dark, lies the grey. Like grey jedi, youre strictly accepting of what both sides have to offer, but it makes you a target; you can have the best of both worlds. Hence why you must bring a balance to the force. There is a dark and light side, they have to equal out.
